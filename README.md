# CdBase
CdBase is a simple CD collection library made in HTML5/CSS with bootstrap, php and Mysql.

You can consider that as a first step or a first edition.
For now it's a simple collection browser with a tool using MusicBrainz to add you CDs.
If cover are not available you can add another from web url.

Install is very easy, just unzip the files in your www folder and import the Table.sql in a new database.
Edit the db_connect.php file with the correct login and pass for the database.

I change the design because i don't have enough time to work on that, so i choose a simple but cool bootstrap template from startbootstrap.com

For the next step i will add tracks data and Band Bio !

See you !
